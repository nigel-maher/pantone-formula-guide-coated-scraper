# Pantone Formula Guide Coated Scraper

Scrape "Formula Guide Coated" colour data from [pantone.com](https://www.pantone.com/)
and write it to a CSV file.

Pantone make colours from this guide freely available via their
[online colour finder](https://www.pantone.com/color-finder/).

**This project was a learning exercise only** but may be useful in certain fringe
situations.

If you are offline and your design application does not include the most recent
colours from this swatchbook, you can use this script to scrape them.

Tested on the 2019 Pantone Color Finder.
